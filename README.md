# CollectionApp
The CollectionApp application is simple and suitable for collectors.


# purpose of production

My purpose of making this app is for fun and learning. I had a lot of fun doing this project but there is nothing to exaggerate about it. It is just an app for collectors.

# application and code structure

I tried to make the application structure as user-friendly as possible. Since the application is console-based, I tried to write it in an understandable way. Also, when it comes to the code structure, it has a modular, clean and understandable structure. It is open to development.

# Possible improvements

Since the application and code structure are understandable, further developments can be made. The database, iu and gui, as well as the written codes can be made cleaner and more understandable. The application I made is completely open to development and can be used as desired.

# How to use?

Make sure the code files are in the proper order. You can use your preferred IDE (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Also the file order should be as follows:
Main.java - 
menu.java - 
collection.java - 
user.java - 
inputhelper.java

It would be beneficial to make sure that the codes are complete and the files are in the correct location. If you want to try it, I wish you good fun.
